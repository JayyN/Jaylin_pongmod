For the pong game i changed the paddle size of the paddle to make the game alittle harder to hit the ball
the paddle size i made the width:10 and the height: 50
I put the score up to 10 instead of 3 to keep the game going instead of making the game shorter

The pong game we created was alittle hard from the start but from watching the videos made the code easier to learn and do everyday we would watch a new video for the next step of the code for the game
